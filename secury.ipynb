# This allows us to work with the newline character:
define newline


endef
newline := $(newline)

# nl-escape
#
# Usage: escape = $(call nl-escape[,escape])
#
# This is used as the common way to specify
# what should replace a newline when escaping
# newlines; the default is a bizarre string.
#
nl-escape = $(if $(1),$(1),m822df3020w6a44id34bt574ctac44eb9f4n)

# escape-nl
#
# Usage: escaped-text = $(call escape-nl,text[,escape])
#
# GNU make's $(shell ...) function converts to a
# single space each newline character in the output
# produced during the expansion; this may not be
# desirable.
#
# The only solution is to change each newline into
# something that won't be converted, so that the
# information can be recovered later with
# $(call unescape-nl...)
#
escape-nl = $(subst $(newline),$(call nl-escape,$(2)),$(1))

# unescape-nl
#
# Usage: text = $(call unescape-nl,escaped-text[,escape])
#
# See escape-nl.
#
unescape-nl = $(subst $(call nl-escape,$(2)),$(newline),$(1))

# shell-escape-nl
#
# Usage: $(shell some-command | $(call shell-escape-nl[,escape]))
#
# Use this to escape newlines from within a shell call;
# the default escape is a bizarre string.
#
# NOTE: The escape is used directly as a string constant
#       in an `awk' program that is delimited by shell
#       single-quotes, so be wary of the characters
#       that are chosen.
#
define shell-escape-nl
awk 'NR==1 {t=$$0} NR>1 {t=t "$(nl-escape)" $$0} END {printf t}'
endef
# shell-unescape-nl
#
# Usage: $(shell some-command | $(call shell-unescape-nl[,escape]))
#
# Use this to unescape newlines from within a shell call;
# the default escape is a bizarre string.
#
# NOTE: The escape is used directly as an extended regular
#       expression constant in an `awk' program that is
#       delimited by shell single-quotes, so be wary
#       of the characters that are chosen.
#
# (The bash shell has a bug where `{gsub(...),...}' is
#  misinterpreted as a brace expansion; this can be
#  overcome by putting a space between `{' and `gsub').
#
define shell-unescape-nl
awk 'NR==1 {t=$$0} NR>1 {t=t "\n" $$0} END { gsub(/$(nl-escape)/,"\n",t); printf t }'
